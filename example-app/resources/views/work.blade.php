        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed">It may feel a bit overwhelming to find a job, but don't worry. There always is a way to find it.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-2 mt-4 text-lg font-semibold text-gray-900 dark:text-black">Temporary work agencies</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Temporary work agencies are a great way to find a job. They have many job offers and can help you find a job that fits your skills and schedule. They do most of the "dirty" work needed to find an employer.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Unfortunately, the work is temporary and you can suddenly get fired. Also, the earnings are lower (as far as I heard).</p>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-900">JKS</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">JKS is one of Denmark's largest and most well-known temp and recruitment agencies, and they have a local office right here in Horsens.
            You sign up with them for free, creating a profile with your skills, experience, and what kind of work you're looking for. Companies in and around Horsens who need staff then contact JKS.</p>


        <dl class="max-w-md text-gray-900 divide-y divide-gray-200 dark:text-white dark:divide-gray-800 font-semibold">
            <div class="flex flex-col pb-3">
                <dt class="mb-1 text-gray-500 md:text-lg dark:text-black italic">Temporary work</dt>
                <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-800">This is their specialty. If a company is extra busy, needs someone to cover for an employee on sick leave, or has a short-term project, they hire a vikar through JKS. This could be for a single day, a week, or several months. It's a great way to earn money without a long-term commitment.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="flex flex-col py-3">
                <dt class="mb-1 text-gray-500 md:text-lg dark:text-black italic font-semibold">Try & hire</dt>
                <dd class="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-800"> Sometimes, a temporary position can lead to a full-time job. With a "Try & Hire" setup, you start as a temp worker through JKS for a trial period. If both you and the company are happy, they offer you a permanent contract. Itâ€™s like a working interview.</dd>

        </dl>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-900">Vikar A/S</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">Think of Vikar A/S as another key player you should sign up with. They function as a professional matchmaker between companies needing staff and people looking for jobs. They have a strong network of client companies in Horsens and the surrounding region.</p>

                <p class="text-lg font-semibold text-neutral-800">They specialize in providing temporary staff to companies in various sectors. Mainly, warehouse worker, production worker, construction worker, office worker, etc.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-3 mt-4 text-neutral-800 dark:text-neutral-900">Facebook groups</h2>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">A popular way to land a job is just being part of any of the Facebook groups for internationals. You can find them in this section <a href="social#fb" class=" text-blue-700 underline hover:text-blue-700 focus:z-10 focus:ring-4 focus:outline-none focus:ring-gray-100 focus:text-blue-700"> here.</a> A lot of local shops and restaurants post job offers on these groups.</p>
        <p class="font-bold text-gray-900 underline dark:text-black decoration-indigo-500">Its my personal recommendation as it gives you the most freedom.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed pb-8">They really depend on the kind of work you do. But I can give you some approximates (after tax). Please be aware that these are the estimates and the actual earnings can vary due to many circumstances.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed pb-8">Internship is a great way to gain experience and make connections in your field. It is usually unpaid but it can lead to a full-time job.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-600 dark:text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">You can find internship opportunities on your programme's website or by asking your teachers.
